# Structural and Evolutionary Genomics

# What is this?
This repository contains a presentation done by me and a classmate in the curricular unit Structural and Evolutionary Genomics in my 
Bioinformatics degree. 
This presentation was about a protein (oxytocin) and required a bit of research by both of us. 

# What I learned?
With this presentation, I learned to use fasta files and to do phylogenetic threes using a tool called "T-Rex".
I also learned more about these protein-like functions, its history and in what organisms can it be found.
I hope it can be useful in a near future.
